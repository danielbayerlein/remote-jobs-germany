# Remote-friendly german companies

A list of semi to fully remote-friendly companies in or around tech.

**Contributions are very welcome!** Pull requests will be accepted if the
company is at least partially remote, they are added in alphabetical order in
the list, and are added with a website.

Inspired by [remote-jobs](https://github.com/jessicard/remote-jobs) and
